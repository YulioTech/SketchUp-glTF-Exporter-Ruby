Sketchup.require 'sketchup'
Sketchup.require 'extensions'

# 1.1.0 Support 8-bit ubyte indices
#       Fixed exception handler
#				Fixed an issue for when the json text contained utf8 multibyte characters
#	1.1.1 Fixed inversed textures
#       Fixed metallicFactor default value - textured materials had default metallicity of 1 (metal) rather than 0 (diaellectric)
# 1.1.2 Add Sketchup.require
# 1.2.0 Add file-save dialog box when exporting the model, default to the same directory and name as the existing model.
# 1.2.1 Do not export hidden entities
#       Export metallicFactor and roughnessFactor from dictionary attributes
#       Allow scripted exports to specify filename
#       Orientate model to face viewer
#       Export textures from group/components
# 1.2.2 Fixed issue with nil material exported in un-grouped geometry
# 1.2.3 Do not export if the entity is on a hidden layer
#       Fixed issue with min/max values of accessors
# 1.2.4 sRGB to linear color space conversion
# 1.2.5 Export sampler to correct issues with textures
# 1.3.0 Remove support for original Microsoft .glb files, as they have now fixed their issues
#       Allow setting material metallic, roughness, emissive, and doubleSided properties through material naming convention
#       Add BLEND property if the material contains a texture, as it might contain alpha transparency and the Sketchup API doesn't tell us.
#       Fixed an issue where the material from an outer group or component being used to paint nested faces was not used in the final model.
#       Set glTF copyright field from model.description
# 1.3.1 Drop the use of 8-bit indexes as this is not supported by many GPUs/Engines and may be dropped from future glTF specification.
# 2.0.0 Added support for the camera export
# 		Changed the mesh accumulation, export and relevant buffer view generation mechanism to be performed on a per mesh per material basis. This cuts down the export times by a factor of 2x and drastically improves the speed and memory consumption when exported files are imported via Assimp.
# 		Added optional support for multiple buffer generation in exported files (if needed)
# 		Currently mesh vertices are exported without welding for performance reasons (additional ~30% speed improvement) at the expense of bigger exported file sizes (this could be changed to hash based welding; see the code in MeshData class)
# 		Overall re-factoring to clean up and remove redundant code
# 		Various small performance optimizations and hardening
# 		Added some missing internationalization resource strings
# 2.1.0 Added ImageMagick app to convert images to .png
# 		Passed FOV to gltf from SU
# 2.2.0 Fixed RGBA blending not being supported when a texture was specified for a material
# 		A fix to suppress duplicate geometry in CET exported scenes
